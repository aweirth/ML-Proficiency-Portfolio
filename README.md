# Machine Learning in R Portfolio

### This repository contains my coursework using R Studio to utilize a variety of supervised machine learning algorithims. The current contents of this repo are as follows:

**Regression Modeling**:

- Data Cleaning -> Linear Regression
- Non-Linear Regression (Polynomial & GAM)
- LOOCV & LASSO Regression

**Classification Modeling**:

- Decision Trees and Ensemble Learning (Aggregation with Bagging & Boosting)
- K-Nearest Neighbors
